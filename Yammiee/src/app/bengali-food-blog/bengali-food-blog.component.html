    <p class="intro">
      At <strong>Yammiee</strong>, we take you on a flavorful journey to Bengal with our Traditional Bengali Thali. 
      A perfect harmony of spices, textures, and heritage — every dish tells a story of comfort, culture, and culinary excellence.
    </p>

    <h2>🐟 Shorshe Ilish — The Crown Jewel</h2>
    <p>
      We use the iconic Hilsa fish, marinated and cooked gently in a pungent mustard sauce with green chilies and mustard oil. 
      It’s bold, flavorful, and the true pride of Bengali kitchens.
    </p>

    <h2>🦐 Chingri Malai Curry — Royal Indulgence</h2>
    <p>
      Succulent prawns are simmered in a smooth coconut milk gravy, enriched with aromatic spices and ghee. 
      This creamy dish is a luxurious addition to the Thali, much loved by seafood lovers.

    <h2>🥦 Shukto — The Bitter Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      A traditional starter, Shukto is a lightly bitter medley of vegetables balanced with sweetness and a touch of mustard and fenugreek. 
      It cleanses the palate and awakens the appetite.
    </p>

    <h2>🍆 Begun Bhaja — Crispy Delight</h2>
    <p>
      Thick slices of eggplant, marinated in turmeric and salt, then shallow-fried in mustard oil until golden and crispy. 
      A comforting and crunchy favorite.
    </p>

    <h2>🍨 Mishti Doi — The Sweet Finale</h2>
    <p>
      Our meal ends with the quintessential Bengali dessert — Mishti Doi. This sweetened, caramelized yogurt is served chilled, 
      bringing a creamy, tangy end to your traditional feast.
    </p>

    <h2>🎉 Experience the Culture</h2>
    <p>
      Every bite in this Thali carries warmth and nostalgia, making it perfect for festive meals or a hearty family dinner. 
      Crafted with love, served with tradition — that’s the Yammiee promise.
