    <p class="intro">
      At <strong>Yammiee</strong>, our Chicken Biryani isn’t just a meal — it's a memory wrapped in layers of spice, aroma, and love. 
      Our chefs bring generations of tradition to your plate, making every bite unforgettable.
    </p>

    <h2>🍗 The Heart of the Dish — The Chicken</h2>
    <p>
      We start with fresh, tender cuts of chicken marinated for hours in a blend of yogurt, turmeric, red chili, and garam masala. 
      This ensures each piece soaks up all the rich flavors before it’s cooked to juicy perfection.
    </p>

    <h2>🍚 Basmati Rice — The Fragrant Canvas</h2>
    <p>
      Our long-grain basmati rice is steamed with saffron and whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and star anise. 
      This creates the perfect base — aromatic, fluffy, and golden.
    </p>

    <h2>🌿 Secret Spice Blend</h2>
    <p>
      What sets Yammiee’s Biryani apart is our unique hand-ground spice mix. 
      A family-kept secret, it strikes the perfect balance between heat, aroma, and flavor — elevating the entire dish.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 Dum Cooking — The Traditional Way</h2>
    <p>
      We use the age-old dum method to seal in the flavors. Layers of marinated chicken and spiced rice are slow-cooked in a sealed pot, 
      allowing the ingredients to cook in their own steam, resulting in a deeply flavorful dish.
    </p>

    <h2>🥗 Served With Love</h2>
    <p>
      Each order of Chicken Biryani is served hot with a side of cooling raita, tangy salad, and a piece of lemon. 
      Whether you dine in or order online, we promise a royal meal every time.
